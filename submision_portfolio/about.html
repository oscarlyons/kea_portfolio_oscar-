            <p>As a multi media designer at kea I’ve experimented with lots of different modes of design from websites to apps. I think of all the projects I enjoyed the animation week the most. Building characters and worlds was particularly enjoyable. I the future id like to gain a better understanding of the programing involved to make it interactive. As kea student I have focus my time growing accustomed to adobe software’s and design principles of which previously I wasn’t complexly clear on. I’ve also attempted to gain a grip on coding which is slowly becoming clearer to me but its early stages. </p>
